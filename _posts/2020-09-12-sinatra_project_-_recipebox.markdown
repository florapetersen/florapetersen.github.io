I went into this project feeling behind in the material and unprepared for the task - to create a Sinatra wep app from scratch. I was having serious doubts about my abilities; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that things began to make more sense as I went along and the project in itself was a great way to learn and solidify some concepts. 

I decided to create an app called RecipeBox, where users can post and store recipes. Cooking and baking are things that I enjoy and so this seemed like it could lend itself to plenty of creativity. In the final (so far) product, users can create and post recipes, categorize their recipes, and browse others' recipes by category. In an ideal world, this app would turn into more of a social networking platform where users could follow each other to keep up with their favorite bakers and chefs. Maybe someday, but my coding skills aren't quite that far along yet!

This project integrated SQLite, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, Ruby, CSS and HTML. A lot to think about, but I can slowly feel my brain getting more comfortable. Overwhelmingly confusing at first, the request-response cycle become easier to follow after plenty of practice and repetition. It's still intimidating to think about everything I have left to learn, but it's so exciting to see my code actually coming to life on a web browser! I can't wait to see what else I can create.

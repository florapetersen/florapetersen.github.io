I just wrapped up my first project with Flatiron School, the CLI Data Gem, and I couldn't be happier to be finished. Looking back at my code, it's funny that the whole thing seems so simple. In reality, some moments along the way felt hopeless and there were definitely a few tears involved!

Coming up with an idea was simple; it would be related to some kind of summer activity. My first story idea was a user who wanted to learn how to swim. I would build a program where she could search for swimming pools in her area that offered adult lessons. The problem was that I didn't actually know what an API really was and so I was going to random Parks and Recreation websites trying to find their API! This obviously wasn't working and I was so confused. Eventually, my own mother had to explain to me what an API actually is. Again, it seems simple now (why did I think I could just go to any website - what a dummy!) but it took a minute for me to wrap my head around! I switched up my project idea and, after some trial and errors, ended up finding an API called TrailAPI that contains data about mountain biking trails. I decided I would create a program where the user could search for trails in their area and find more information about those trails. 

After getting my API, I was excited to finally have found something that worked. However, now I was totally stuck and had no idea where to go next. Google wasn't helping. This is where the tears came in! One thing I know very well is that there's nothing wrong with asking for help and no shame in admitting that you have absolutely no idea what's going on. Trying to pretend you know more than you do will never get you anywhere. So a classmate and I told our cohort lead that we needed the "Building a CLI Gem for Dummies" version. As in, broken down step by step. And that's exactly what we got! It was so helpful and ended up being helpful for the rest of the cohort as well. Once I got through that, I felt so much better and was ready to actually start writing the bulk of my program. 

The rest of the project was pretty fun. I liked being able to envision how the program would work as an actual app and experimenting with finding all the different trails in different locations. One thing I would do differently next time would be relying less on help from demos and walk-throughs. In another conversation with my mom (we talk about coding a lot), she said "why not? Better to learn the best way to do things the first time rather than wasting time fumbling around." I think she's right and do see a lot of value in that. But also, I know that a lot of this I could have figured out entirely on my own without any help. For the future, I'm going to work on trusting myself and my knowledge. I know more than I think I do!
